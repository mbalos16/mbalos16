## Hello 👩‍💻!

Fancy seeing you here 😌 !

I am Maria Balos, a data scientist and user-centric designer based in Cambridge, UK. Nowadays, I work for VocalityAI, training TTS models, so you can find me most of the time behind a screen or next to a cup of coffee. In my free time, I enjoy solving problems on Leetcode or experimenting while working on personal projects. Please grab a coffee and feel welcome to this small corner of my work!

## Projects
- [Space Mission Analysis](<https://github.com/mbalos16/python_100_days_of_code/blob/master/day_99/Space_Missions_Analysis_(start).ipynb>) is a data exploration and data visualisation project where I applied most of the data visualisation libraries.
- [Mohs Hardness Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mbalos/the-power-of-decision-stumps): Decision Stump (one layer decision tree) for a Kaggle competition, this placed me in position 598/1632 at the end of the competition. A [decision stump presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BtiAuhvKhAHsHSI_taXHQAGqqi_DwVnxTlF2grQtQQE/edit?usp=sharing) has been created to introduce Datamecum students to decision stumps.
- [Datamecum Datathon](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EDDbKSY5zzrLBYdYQrRcz3SuSAGo0B7NHvDc3C-132A/edit?usp=sharing) - Capstone project competition between the third promotion students of the Intensive Program in Data Science by DATAMECUM, consisting of building a supervised model to predict a binary class. The exploratory data analysis consisted of:
  - checking for missing values.
  - handling duplicated values and ambiguous data.
  - exploring the relation between missing values and the target variable.
  - self-organising maps and correlation matrix used for correlation checks.
- [Weever Watermark](https://github.com/mbalos16/python_100_days_of_code/blob/master/day_85/watermark.py): Applying K-Means and arrays transformation to group the colours of a provided image and use the generated centroids to create a 10-colour palette into a GUI API created with Flask. Please have a look at the [Weever Watermark DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoJuX5uoKas) or at the [Machine learning applied to the design industry: K-Means for image palette generation](https://medium.com/@mariabalos16/machine-learning-applied-to-the-design-industry-k-means-for-image-palette-generation-dbd908b2312b) article, where I explain the project.
