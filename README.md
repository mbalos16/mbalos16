## Hello üë©‚Äçüíª!

Fancy seeing you here üòå !

I am Maria Balos, a data scientist and user-centric designer based in Cambridge, UK. You can find me most of the time behind a screen or next to a coffee. Welcome to this small corner of my work!

Right now I am involved into:

- **Datathon capstone project** - supervised model competition between the third promotion students of the Intensive Program in Data Science by DATAMECUM - ending on May
- Preparing to join the **Master in Deep Learning and Generative AI** by DATAMECUM - October 2024 - April 2025
- Finishing the last 16/100 projects of the course **100 Days Of Code in Python** by Angela Yu on Udemy.
- Working on my **career development**, please check [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariabalos) for more details.

## Projects üìú

### `Exploratory Data Analysis`

- [Space Mission Analysis](<https://github.com/mbalos16/python_100_days_of_code/blob/master/day_99/Space_Missions_Analysis_(start).ipynb>) is a data exploration and data visualisation project where I applied most of the data visualisation libraries.
- [Mohs Hardness Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mbalos/the-power-of-decision-stumps): Decision Stump (one layer decision tree) for a Kaggle competition, this placed me in position 598/1632 at the end of the competition. A [decision stump presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BtiAuhvKhAHsHSI_taXHQAGqqi_DwVnxTlF2grQtQQE/edit?usp=sharing) has been created to introduce Datamecum students to decision stumps.

### `Machine Learning`

#### Unsupervised

- [Weever Watermark](https://github.com/mbalos16/python_100_days_of_code/blob/master/day_85/watermark.py): Applying K-Means and arrays transformation to group the colours of a provided image and use the generated centroids to create a 10-colour palette into a GUI API created with Flask. Please have a look at the [Weever Watermark DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoJuX5uoKas) or at the [Machine learning applied to the design industry: K-Means for image palette generation](https://medium.com/@mariabalos16/machine-learning-applied-to-the-design-industry-k-means-for-image-palette-generation-dbd908b2312b) article where I explain the project.

#### Supervised

-[Datamecum Dataton](####Supervised) - ongoing competition consiting of building a supervised model to predict a binary class. **Please get in touch if you'd like a link to the repository**.

### `Web / App Development`

- [Typing Thunder](https://github.com/mbalos16/python_100_days_of_code/blob/master/day_86/main.py): a speed-typing GUI app created to measure how fast the user type in one minute. [Typing Thunder DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olHJpy0Nywc)
- [Morse Code](https://github.com/mbalos16/python_100_days_of_code/tree/master/day_82): a command-line program where the dictionary loops, strings and functions in Python are applied. [Morse Converter DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvHdGF5BKtY)
- [MochaMaps](https://github.com/mbalos16/python_100_days_of_code/commit/478aa555df8d46696f5b7d91501aa563d455ad15): a website that displays coffee shops and their facilities from a database by using: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2, REST API, Flask API and Bootstrap-Flask. [MockaMaps DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NSE_zE_FBE)


### `Automation`

- [LinkedIn Toggler](###Automation): Using Selenium for Python to automate recurrent LinkedIn tasks. Please have a look at the [LinkedIn Toggler repository](https://github.com/mbalos16/linkedin_toggler) if you want to know more about this project.
